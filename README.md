# CO2-emissions-prediction
In order to predict the CO2 emissions by automobiles, I utilized data collected by Canadian agencies. I used the data in order to create a scatterplot to find a pattern. The obvious design seemed like a linear equation to model the data. I then performed linear regression using python and it's libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib in order to calculate the line of best fit.  I was able to get a final R^2 score of ~0.71, which is good cause we know that the line models the data nicely. In the end, I calculated the mean absolute error and mean squared error. I plan to make another program that uses multiple linear regression in order to have a more accurate prediction of the type of vehicle.
